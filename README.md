# ALIENS-R-REAL JavaScript Project

In this little HTML/JavaScript project, we exercise our acquired
JavaScript skills to display and filter a table with alledged UFU
sightings. We are using the d3 library and plain modern JavaScript in this
project.

Note that the design of the page is based on Bootstrap 3.3.7. It's
taken from the starter html/javascript that was provided with the
exercise instructions. There was too little time to customize the
design.
