# ALIENS-R-REAL JavaScript Project

In this little HTML/JavaScript project, we exercise our acquired
JavaScript skills to display and sort a table with alledged UFU
sightings.

Note that the design of the page is based on Bootstrap 3.3.7. It's
taken from the starter html/javascript that was provided with the
exercise instructions. There was too little time to customize the
design.
