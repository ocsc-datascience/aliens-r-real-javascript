# ALIENS-R-REAL JavaScript Project

In this little HTML/JavaScript project, we exercise our acquired
JavaScript skills to display and sort a table with alledged UFU
sightings.

Note that the design of the page is taken from the starter
html/javascript that was provided with the exercise
instructions. There was too little time to customize the design.
